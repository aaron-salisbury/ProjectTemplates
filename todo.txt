- Add a sample that validates against a business domain object and decorates the view with the messages.

- Win7App, replace ModernUI.WPF with something that doesn't take over the entire window. Adonis UI looks promising.

- The log views in the .NET Framework apps only use strings. Update to be structured.

- Replace ExtensionAttribute in the core project with another technique. It's fine for .NET Framework 2.0, but the other project targets already have it.
