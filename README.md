Project Templates
==========================

Visual Studio extension for legacy project templates just in case I find myself in a restricted development scenario. 

For Windows 10 I recommend [Windows Template Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WASTeamAccount.WindowsTemplateStudio) instead.

Info
----
The extension has project templates that create a sample application that target specific generations of Windows and .Net frameworks and contain example screens and processes.

Each solution contains two projects, the app project which should be set as the startup project, and a "Core" library. The core library is setup for business logic, models, and domains, but does not presume a design pattern and could be further split a part however desired.

Included project templates:

  - Windows 7 App Solution Template (.NET Framework 4.5.1)
